  This project is a course design I made at the end of my freshman year. Its purpose is to provide some ideas for freshmen.
  
  First, we need to configure a certain environment. Some convenient integrated development environments are very helpful, such as VScode, visual studio, etc. Here I choose to use visual studio 2022, which involves the operation of the graphical interface, so We want to download the easyx graphics library
   
  the download link of easyx is: 
https://easyx.cn/
  the download link of visual studio is:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

  I divided the code into several parts, put the header files in the same folder, and then placed the source files separately. The resource files were also placed in the same folder. You should have a certain ability to identify and organize them.

  The code can continue to be improved. Due to the restrictions on the language used at that time, I deleted the language part of c++ after thinking about it. Therefore, the functions of this project are not complete, and this project has gone through several update iterations. The internal The game_help part is for reference only. I recommend you to make a major transformation of this project. I have forgotten what the most complete project function is. You can make bold innovations.

  Letâ€™s write this much for now
